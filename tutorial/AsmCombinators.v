(** * Composition of [asm] programs *)

(** We develop in this file a theory of linking for [asm] programs.
    To this end, we will equip them with four main combinators:
    - [pure_asm], casting pure functions into [asm]. 
    - [app_asm], linking them vertically
    - [link_asm], hiding internal links
    - [relabel_asm], allowing to rename labels
    Viewing [asm] units as diagrams, whose entry wires are the exposed labels of
    its blocks, and exit wires the external labels to which it may jump, this
    theory can be seen in particular as showing that they enjoy a structure of
    _traced monoidal category_.
    We do so by thinking of [ktree]s as a theory of linking at the denotational
    level. Each linking combinator is therefore proved correct by showing that
    the denotation of the resulting [asm], a [ktree],  can be swapped with the
    corresponding [ktree] combinator.
    It is interesting to notice that while the [ktree] theory, provided by the
    library, required heavy use of coinduction, it provides sufficient reasoning
    principles so that we do not need to write any cofix here.

(** ** Correctness *)
(** We show the combinators correct by proving that their denotation
    map to their [ktree] counterparts.
    Since these combinators are the basic blocks we'll use in the
    compiler to link compiled subterms, these correctness lemmas
    will provide an equational theory sufficient to conduct
    all needed reasoning.
    Interestingly, [ktree] provides a sufficiently rich theory to
    prove all these results involving [denote_asm], which is expressed
    as a [loop], equationally.

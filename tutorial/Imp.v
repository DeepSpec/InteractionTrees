(** * The Imp language  *)

(** We now demonstrate how to use ITrees in the context of verified compilation.
    To this end, we will consider a simple compiler from an imperative language
    to a control-flow-graph language.  The meaning of both languages will be
    given in terms of ITrees, so that the proof of correctness is expressed by
    proving a bisimulation between ITrees.

    We shall emphasize two main satisfying aspects of the resulting
    formalization.

    - Despite the correctness being termination-sensitive, we do not write any
      cofixpoints. All reasoning is purely equational, and the underlying
      coinductive reasoning is hidden on the library side.

    - We split the correctness in two steps. First, a linking theory of the CFG
      language is proved correct. Then, this theory is leveraged to prove the
      functional correctness of the compiler. The first piece is fairly generic,
      and hence reusable.

(** We start by introducing a simplified variant of Software
    Foundations' [Imp] language.  The language's semantics is first expressed in
    terms of [itree]s.  The semantics of the program can then be obtained by
    interpreting the events contained in the trees.

(** ** Semantics *)

(** _Imp_ produces effects by manipulating its variables.  To account for this,
    we define a type of _external interactions_ [ImpState] modeling reads and
    writes to global variables.

    A read, [GetVar], takes a variable as an argument and expects the
    environment to answer with a value, hence defining an event of type
    [ImpState value].

    Similarly, [SetVar] is a write event parameterized by both a variable and a
    value to be written, and defines an event of type [ImpState unit], no
    informative answer being expected from the environment.  *)
Class MonadStateImp (m : Type -> Type) : Type :=
  { get_var : var -> m value
  ; set_var : var -> value -> m unit
  }.

Section Denote.

  (** We now proceed to denote _Imp_ expressions and statements.
      We could simply fix in stone the universe of events to be considered,
      taking as a semantic domain for _Imp_ [itree ImpState X]. That would be
      sufficient to give meaning to _Imp_, but would prohibit us from relating this
      meaning to [itree]s stemmed from other entities. Therefore, we
      parameterize the denotation of _Imp_ by a larger universe of events [eff],
      of which [ImpState] is assumed to be a subevent. *)

  Context {m : Type -> Type}.
  Context {Monad_m : Monad m}.
  Context {MonadStateImp_m : MonadStateImp m}.

  (** _Imp_ expressions are denoted as [itree eff value], where the returned
      value in the tree is the value computed by the expression.
      In the [Var] case, the [trigger] operator smoothly lifts a single event to
      an [itree] by performing the corresponding [Vis] event and returning the
      environment's answer immediately.
      A constant (literal) is simply returned.
      Usual monadic notations are used in the other cases: we can [bind]
      recursive computations in the case of operators as one would expect. *)

  Fixpoint denote_expr (e : expr) : m value :=
    match e with
    | Var v     => get_var v
    | Lit n     => ret n
    | Plus a b  => l <- denote_expr a ;; r <- denote_expr b ;; ret (l + r)
    | Minus a b => l <- denote_expr a ;; r <- denote_expr b ;; ret (l - r)
    | Mult a b  => l <- denote_expr a ;; r <- denote_expr b ;; ret (l * r)
    end.

  (** We turn to the denotation of statements. As opposed to expressions,
      statements do not return any value: their semantic domain is therefore
      [itree eff unit]. The most interesting construct is, naturally, [while].

      To define its meaning, we make use of the [iter] combinator provided by
      the [itree] library:

      [iter : (A -> itree E (A + B)) -> A -> itree E B].

      The combinator takes as argument the body of the loop, i.e. a function
      that maps inputs of type [A], the accumulator, to an [itree] computing
      either a new [A] that can be fed back to the loop, or a return value of
      type [B]. The combinator builds the fixpoint of the body, hiding away the
      [A] argument from the return type.

      Compared to the [mrec] and [rec] combinators introduced in
      [Introduction.v], [iter] is more restricted in that it naturally
      represents tail recursive functions.  It, however, enjoys a rich equational
      theory: its addition grants the type of _continuation trees_ (named
      [ktree]s in the library), a structure of _traced monoidal category_.

      We use [loop] to first build a new combinator [while].
      The accumulator degenerates to a single [unit] value indicating
      whether we entered the body of the while loop or not. Since the
      the operation does not return any value, the return type is also
      taken to be [unit].
      That is, the right tag [inr tt] says to exit the loop,
      while the [inl tt] says to continue. *)

  (** Casting values into [bool]:  [0] corresponds to [false] and any nonzero
      value corresponds to [true].  *)
  Definition is_true (v : value) : bool := negb (v =? 0)%nat.

  Definition if_ (b : m value) (t e : m unit) : m unit :=
    v <- b ;;
    if is_true v then t else e.

  Definition while `{MonadIter m} (b : m value) (step : m unit) : m unit :=
    Basics.iter (fun _ =>
      v <- b ;;
      if is_true v then
        step ;; ret (inl tt)
      else
        ret (inr tt)) tt.

  (** The meaning of statements is now easy to define.  They are all
      straightforward, except for [While], which uses our new [while] combinator
      over the computation that evaluates the conditional, and then the body if
      the former was true.  *)
  Fixpoint denote_stmt `{MonadIter m} (s : stmt) : m unit :=
    match s with
    | Assign x e => v <- denote_expr e ;; set_var x v
    | Seq a b    => denote_stmt a ;; denote_stmt b
    | If i t e   => if_ (denote_expr i) (denote_stmt t) (denote_stmt e)
    | While t b => while (denote_expr t) (denote_stmt b)
    | Skip => ret tt
    end.

  (** We have given _a_ notion of denotation to [fact 6] via [denote_stmt].
      However, this is naturally not actually runnable yet, since it contains
      uninterpreted [ImpState] events.  We therefore now need to _handle_ the
      events contained in the trees, i.e. give a concrete interpretation of the
      environment.  *)

(** We provide an _ITree event handler_ to interpret away [ImpState] events.  We
    use an _environment event_ to do so, modeling the environment as a
    0-initialized map from strings to values.  Recall from [Introduction.v] that
    a _handler_ for the events [ImpState] is a function of type [forall R, ImpState R
    -> M R] for some monad [M].  Here we take for our monad the special case of
    [M = itree E] for some universe of events [E] required to contain the
    environment events [mapE] provided by the library. It comes with an event
    interpreter [interp_map] that yields a computation in the state monad.  *)

   an [itree (mapE var value) unit].
   Finally, [interp_map] interprets the latter [itree] into the state monad,
   resulting in an [itree] free of any event, but returning the final
   _Imp_ env.

(** * The Imp language  *)

(** We now demonstrate how to use ITrees in the context of verified compilation.
    To this end, we will consider a simple compiler from an imperative language
    to a control-flow-graph language.
    The meaning of both languages will be given in terms of ITrees, so that the
    proof of correctness is expressed by proving a bisimulation between ITrees.
    We shall emphasize two main satisfying aspects of the resulting formalization.
    - Despite the correctness being termination-sensitive, we do not write any
    cofixpoints. All reasoning is purely equational, and the underlying
    coinductive reasoning is hidden on the library side.
    - We split the correctness in two steps. First, a linking theory of the CFG language
    is proved correct. Then, this theory is leveraged to prove the functional correctness
    of the compiler. The first piece is fairly generic, and hence reusable.

(** We therefore start by introducing a simplified variant of Software Foundations'
    [Imp] language.
    The language's semantics is first expressed in terms of [itree]s.
    The semantics of the program can then be obtained by
    interpreting the events contained in the trees.

(** ** Semantics *)

(** _Imp_ produces effects by manipulating its variables.
    To account for this, we define a type of _external interactions_
    [Locals] modeling reads and writes to variables.
    A read, [GetVar], takes a variable as an argument and expects the
    environment to answer with a value, hence defining an event of type
    [Locals value].
    Similarly, [SetVar] is a write event parameterized by both a variable
    and a value to be written, and defines an event of type [Locals unit],
    no informative answer being expected from the environment.
 *)
Variant Locals : Type -> Type :=
| GetVar (x : var) : Locals value
| SetVar (x : var) (v : value) : Locals unit.

Section Denote.

  (** We now proceed to denote _Imp_ expressions and statements.
      We could simply fix in stone the universe of events to be considered,
      taking as a semantic domain for _Imp_ [itree Locals X].
      That would be sufficient to give meaning to _Imp_, but is inconvenient
      to relate this meaning to [itree]s stemmed from other entities.
      Therefore, we parameterize the denotation of _Imp_ by a larger universe
      of events [eff], of which [Locals] is assumed to be a subevent.
   *)

  Context {eff : Type -> Type}.
  Context {HasLocals : Locals -< eff}.

  (** _Imp_ expressions are denoted as [itree eff value], where the returned
      value in the tree is the value computed by the expression.
      In the [Var] case, the [trigger] operator smoothly lifts a single event to
      an [itree] by performing the corresponding [Vis] event and returning the
      environment's answer immediately.
      Usual monadic notations are used in the other cases. A constant
      (literal) is simply returned, while we can [bind] recursive computations
      in the case of operators as one would expect.
   *)
  Fixpoint denoteExpr (e : expr) : itree eff value :=
    match e with
    | Var v => trigger (GetVar v)
    | Lit n => ret n
    | Plus a b => l <- denoteExpr a ;; r <- denoteExpr b ;; ret (l + r)
    | Minus a b => l <- denoteExpr a ;; r <- denoteExpr b ;; ret (l - r)
    | Mult a b => l <- denoteExpr a ;; r <- denoteExpr b ;; ret (l * r)
    end.

  (** We turn to the denotation of statements. As opposed to expressions,
      statements do not return any value: their semantic domain is therefore
      [itree eff unit]. The most interesting construct is naturally [while].

      To define its meaning, we make use of the [loop] combinator provided by
      the [itree] library:
      [loop : (C + A -> itree E (C + B)) -> A -> itree E B].
      The combinator takes as argument the body of the loop, i.e. a function
      that maps inputs of type [C + A] to an [itree] computing either a [C] that
      can be fed back to the loop, or a return value of type [B]. The combinator
      builds the fixpoint of the body, hiding away the [C] argument.
      
      Compared to the [mrec] and [rec] combinators introduced in
      [Introduction.v], [loop] is more restricted in that it naturally
      represents tail recursive functions.
      It however enjoys a rich equational theory: its addition grants the type
      of _continuation trees_, named [ktree]s in the library, a structure of
      _traced monoidal category_.

      We use [loop] to first build a new combinator [while] that takes a boolean
      computation, runs it, and loops if it returns true, exits otherwise.
   *)

  Definition while {eff} (t : itree eff bool) : itree eff unit :=
    loop 
      (fun l : unit + unit =>
         match l with
         | inr _ => ret (inl tt)
         | inl _ => continue <- t ;;
                   if continue : bool then ret (inl tt) else ret (inr tt)
         end) tt.

  (** Casting values into [bool]. *)

  Definition is_true (v : value) : bool := if (v =? 0)%nat then false else true.

  (** The meaning of statements is now easy to define.
      They are all straightforward, except for [While] that uses our new
      [while] combinator over the computation that evaluates the conditional,
      and then the body if the former was true.
   *)
  Fixpoint denoteStmt (s : stmt) : itree eff unit :=
    match s with
    | Assign x e =>
      v <- denoteExpr e ;;
      trigger (SetVar x v)
    | Seq a b =>
      denoteStmt a ;; denoteStmt b
    | If i t e =>
      v <- denoteExpr i ;;
      if is_true v then denoteStmt t else denoteStmt e

      while (v <- denoteExpr t ;;
	             if is_true v
               then denoteStmt b ;; ret true
               else ret false)

  (** We have given _a_ notion of denotation to [fact 6] via [denoteStmt].
      However this is naturally not actually runnable yet, since it contains
      uninterpreted [Locals] events.
      We therefore now need to _handle_ the events contained
      in the trees, i.e. give a concrete interpretation of the environment.

(** We provide an _ITree event handler_ to interpret away [Locals] events.
    We use an _environment event_ to do so, modeling the environment as
    a 0-initialized environment.
    Recall from [Introduction.v] that a _handler_ for the events [Locals]
    is a function of type [forall R, Locals R -> M R] for some monad [M].
    Here we take for our monad the special case of [M = itree E] for some
    universe of events [E] required to contain the environment events [mapE]
    provided by the library. It comes with an event handler [run_map]
    interpreting the computation into the state monad.

(** Finally, we can define an evaluator for our statements.
   To do so, we first denote them, leading to an [itree Locals unit].
   We then [interp]ret [Locals] into [mapE] using [evalLocals], leading to
   an [itree (mapE var value) unit].
   Finally, [run_map] interprets the latter [itree] into the state monad,
   resulting in an [itree] free of any event, but returning an environment.

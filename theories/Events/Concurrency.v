(* An event that spawns a unit-producing thread with events in [E]. *)
Inductive spawnE E : Type -> Type :=
| Spawn : forall (t: itree (spawnE E +' E) unit), spawnE E unit.

Definition spawn {F E} `{(spawnE F) -< E} (t:itree (spawnE F +' F) unit) : itree E unit :=
    trigger (Spawn t).

(* A simple round-robin scheduler:

   This scheduler runs a queue of threads that contain Spawn events.  Each such
   spawned child threads cannot themselves Spwan events (at least not ones
   handled by this scheduler).  Each thread may terminate by returning [tt].  If
   all children threads _and_ the parent thread return, then execution
   terminates, yielding [tt].  If any of the threads diverge, the whole
   scheduled pool diverges.

   With this implementation, the threads could communicate via a shared memory
   via their events [E], but there are no real synchronization primitives that
   could be used to prevent races.


   Another variant: if, in the TauF case, we do:
      Tau (rr ([u] ++ ts))
   We get a different scheduler that only gets control when a thread yields
   by returning or blocking on an external event.  If the first thread silently
   diverges, then the whole system does too.
